                    The second assignment for me personally was a fun way to learn more CSS. I definitely think that this assignment had a lot of challenging
                    aspects such as getting the page model almost exactly right was a tougher. Another issue that I faced was finding the classes to match the 
                    css tags to so I could add sytling to the paticular label or class. A way that I solved that problem was that I focused on things such as the
                    link in case of a picture or like the names that almost described what I was aiming to find.  
                    <br><br>
                    I think the most important thing I learned was how copying a css page initself can be a tough task that takes a lot of trial and error. 
                    That is what I had to do for most of the part where I did a lot of trial and error with the pixals. I think that something I already knew 
                    but I got to explore more was how like some of the css tags can be overriden with extra insight tags. Becuase I was working on one of .container class
                    and then I added a similar tag somewhere else but modified it just a bit and once I took the tag out from the .container it was as if I had never 
                    added it before. Overall it was intresting to see that work in full action. 
                    <br><br>
                    The resources that I relied heavily on was google and just searching up keywords as to how to solve a paticular querey but also my friend Bella. 
                    She helped me just giving me tips as to what tags could work and what tags could be usefull. When it came to using these resources, I just took inspiration
                    from the website as to how a paticular task could be performed and how I can figure that program out when working on a different project. 
                    <br><br>
                    Two things I had to google for this assignment included: 
                    How to resize the media as per the change in the page layout. So using @media was one of the things I had to google and understand. 
                    How to use transform for the sell something button. 
                    What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                    <br><br>
                    Overall this was another successful project!!

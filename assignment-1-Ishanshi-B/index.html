                    <p>Hi my name is Ishanshi Bhardwaj and I go by Ishanshi!  My OSU email address is bhardwai@oregonstate.edu. 
                     I am a sophmore double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
                     The most intresting thing I did in the field of web development was that I made a calculator using react during my senior year without any prior experience with react. 
                     I hope to brush up on my Web dev knowledge and hopefully learn more things that I couldn't during my high school years. 
                     I have signed up for our class on CampusWire!
                     Mosts intresting fact about me is that I have moved about 13 times in my entire life and I actually because of that I really enjoy travelling.

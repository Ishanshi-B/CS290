                    The fourth assignment for me personally was just a lot of figuring out the server and the commands and how it works.
                    I also think that figuring out what the difference between synchronous amd asynchronous was and I was able to program 
                    my code accordingly. The main problem I was having was with the port because I was putting 3000 in my url and also setting
                    a port every time I ran the code and the url wouldn't work. But I figured out that I had to change the 3000 to whatever port
                    I set it up as.
                    <br><br>
                    The things I learned from the assignment was the basic structure of a node js server and how it works. I also finally understood
                    how when one creates the basic server stuff for a website. I think that the special insight after a lot of trial and error was to
                    make sure that the port number is correct because without it the server won't load. I would say that another thing I learned was how 
                    I can work with the asynchronous and synchronous commands. 
                    <br><br>
                    The resources that I relied on were the recorded lecture especially for setting the port. I also used geeksforgeeks to figure out some 
                    of my queries and stackoverflow when my createserver wouldn't work. 
                    Two things I had to google for this assignment included:

                    What does req.url mean?

                    synchronous vs asynchronous in nodejs

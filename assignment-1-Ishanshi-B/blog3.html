                    The third assignment for me personally was a huge learning curve because this time I had to google and learn new things more often.
                    I definitely think that this assignment had a lot of challenging components that I hadn't thought of and I basically had to think of them. 
                    I would say one particular aspect that made this assignment challenging was working with the post and when it came to creating a post that 
                    matched the previous posts. I believe that it can be made efficient but the way I did was creating certain elements and then adding those 
                    components and then adding the divs one by one. 
                    Another aspect that was challenging was working with the filter as I made some of the filters and then I re-read the assignment and looking 
                    at the keywords made me realize that I had to include a lot of conditions.  
                    <br><br>
                    I think that the main thing I learned was more information as to creating an object that utilize a key value system to implement the work.
                    I also think that learning just the various in-built function was quiet a learning curve because I would always look up if the function I was 
                    looking for existed or if i had to create something new. And all the time I looked up a question, there was a function that did exactly what I 
                    needed it to do. Also just learning that the elements can have the various tags one can use such as setting the elements attribute. I think it 
                    was a much efficient way for me to learn as I had to learn one by one if the tags I wanted existed or not. 
                    <br><br>
                    The resources that I relied heavily on was google. This assignment really asked for me to google my queries and the work to figure out answers 
                    to my question. I also think that just random YouTube videos really did help with this as well. They are "random" because I cannot find their links
                    <br><br>
                    Two things I had to google for this assignment included: 
                    <br>
                    1.array.slice and the "..."->Spread Syntax</li>
                    <br>
                    2.How to store a key=> value array in JavaScript ?</How></li>
                    <br><br>
                    Overall this was another successful project!!

                    The fifth assignment was actually easier than most of the other assignments. I believe it is because it was a step by step procedure that was highlighted
                    in our lectures. I think that because I understood the previous content, handlebars were easier to gasp. It was also much more manageable to get this 
                    assignment done because each and every step was nicely written out. One thing about this assignment that was sorta tough was getting the server.js file to be 
                    fully set before deleting the index.html. Also when implementing the program so that it can pull up a single post was challenging because I had to understand
                    how the logic worked when it came to getting the posts as per the number. That meant understanding the parameters that were passed into the app.get, overall this was
                    another successful project!
                    <br><br>
                    The things I learned from the assignment were how to use handlebars and how we can generate a page dynamically at the client side. I was also able to spend 
                    a little bit of time understanding the ways we can create multiple templates and then linking them to each other to fully eliminate the html page. Lastly, 
                    I was able to gain insight regarding the rendering of the various pages with the new programs that we learned in this weeks lecture. I am really proud of 
                    being able to learn how to set up the package.json file so the server runs when I write "npm start".

                    The resources that I relied on included the lectures from this week and google!
                    Two things I had to google for this assignment included: 
                    <br><br>
                    What does "Cannot find module express-handlebars" error mean?
                    <br>
                    What are route parameters?
                    <br><br>
